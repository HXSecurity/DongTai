## About DongTai IAST

`Dongtai IAST` is an open-source Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) tool that enables real-time detection of common vulnerabilities in Java applications and third-party components through passive instrumentation. It is particularly suitable for use in the testing phase of the development pipeline.


## Project structure
```

├── deploy
├── dongtai_common common functions and classes for each service to call
├── dongtai_conf configuration files
├── dongtai_engine vulnerability detection and vulnerability processing part
├── dongtai_protocol protocols for interaction between dongtai-server and agent
├── dongtai_web api for interacting with the web
├── static static files
└── test testcases

```

## Architecture

`DongTai IAST` has multiple basic services, including `DongTai-web`, `DongTai`， `agent`, `DongTai-Base-Image` and `DongTai-Plugin-IDEA`:

- `DongTai-web` is the product page of DongTai, which is used to handle the interaction between users and cave states.
- `DongTai>>dongtai_web` is responsible for handling user-related operations.
- `DongTai>>dongtai_protocol` is used to process the registration/heartbeat/call method/third-party component/error log data reported by `agent`, issue hook strategy, issue probe control commands, etc.
- `DongTai>>dongtai_engine` analyzes whether there are vulnerabilities in HTTP/HTTPS/RPC requests according to the calling method data and taint tracking algorithm, and is also responsible for other related timing tasks.
- `agent` is a probe module of DongTai, including data collection terminals in different programming languages, used to collect data during application runtime and report to the `DongTai-OpenAPI` service.
- `DongTai>>deploy` is used for the deployment of DongTai IAST, including docker-compose single-node deployment, Kubernetes cluster deployment, etc. If you want a deployment plan, you can add features or contribute to the deployment plan.
- `DongTai-Base-Image` contains the basic services that DongTai depends on runtime, including MySql, Redis.
- `DongTai-Plugin-IDEA` is the IDEA plug-in corresponding to the Java probe. You can run the Java probe directly through the plug-in and detect the vulnerabilities directly in IDEA.

## Scenario

The usage scenarios of "DongTai IAST" include but not limited to:

- Embed the `DevSecOps` process to realize automatic detection of application vulnerabilities/third-party component combing/third-party component vulnerability detection.
- Common vulnerability mining for open source software/open source components.
- Security testing before release, etc.

## Quick start

`DongTai IAST` supports **SaaS Service** and **Localized Deployment**. Please refer to [**Deployment Document**](./deploy) for localized deployment.
